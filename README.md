# TellStory

TellStory is a simple and entertaining story generator which takes a sentence and gets the user to build a new 
sentence based off the last one. This continues around all the users. Once completed, the full story can be generated.

## Description

This game was created as a way of practising newly learnt skills within the dev environment. It takes 
an input, stores it in a table, then presents the last input while also recording the new input. It 
then merges all the inputs to generate the story.

It has a very simple UI with a landing page which has a initial starting sentence pulled 
at random. It also has an input area, submit button to submit an entry and a generate story button when all users 
have had thier turn. Once the story has been generated, you have the option to restart the game.
